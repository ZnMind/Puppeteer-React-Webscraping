### Web scraping in Node.js with Puppeteer/Express.

The scraper uses [Puppeteer](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/puppeteer/) from an [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) server to pull game data of professional NA LCS (League of Legends) games.

```
npm start   //runs server on localhost:5000
cd client
npm start   //runs react app on localhost:3000
